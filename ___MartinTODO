MP_CAPABLE 	= Done
MP_JOIN		= Done
MP_DSS		= In process
Scheduler	= In process
CC			= Open
adaptation of sendToApp = Done

Next
=================

- Fill DSS
- adaptation of sendToIP (Is this a must?)
- fill sending queues of alternative paths

Open issues:
=================
- Handshake
- filling sending Queue with netperfmeter (not optimal)

What is new
=================
- 08.13 break up fixed 1:1 PCB <=> Flow relation  

Observations
========================
- Options decrease performance on just one link, this could be a problem for Messages near on MSS. 
- What happend on a round robin scheduler if it scheduled on base of messages or on base of mss, bit stream
