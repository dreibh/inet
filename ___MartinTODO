Status
=================
MP_CAPABLE 	= Done
MP_JOIN		= Done
MP_DSS		= In process
Scheduler	= Round Robin (initial) 
CC			= Open
adaptation of sendToApp = Done
Unordered   = Done

Next
=================
- Fill DSS
- adaptation of sendToIP (Is this a must?)
- fill sending queues of alternative paths
- Something goes wrong with retransmissions in SACK

Open issues:
=================
- Handshake. (there are different variants) 
	- At the moment implciet version is supported

- Option length handling when it is not an multipath connection and data is enqueued 
- For Options there is a bug, by shift of 16 bit for the MPTCP Options
- Messages could only be MTU-Header
- SACK is not working well ... (For my Feeling the Problem is in the retranmission)

Features
=================
- Alternative Scheduler
- Congestion Control
- DSSSeqNo8 = false
- DSSDataACK8 = false

Nice To have
==================
- Rename is not early enough, there are still some Vectores with I0-X
==> Could be ignored, because they just give the info for the first SYN
==> delete all Objects on end
- filling sending Queue with netperfmeter (not optimal)

What is new
=================
- 08.13 break up fixed 1:1 PCB <=> Flow relation  

Observations
========================
- Options decrease performance on just one link, this could be a problem for Messages near on MSS. 
- What happend on a round robin scheduler if it scheduled on base of messages or on base of mss, bit stream
- We have to check up Handshake and many Connection up and downs ..http request

- Die DSS müssen ja nicht sofort mitgesendet werden, was passiert wenn ich hier optimiere....


Work for SHKs
=======================
FIXME -> I have a shift of 16 bit during use of  option->setValues
FIXME -> Sequencenumber handling
FIXME -> MSG Data Queues (something is wrong in their behaivior) -> filling the queue
