	DHCP bugfix: break was missed

2013-12-05  Benmartin92

	DHCP: improved message handling - Output warning msg when client receives
	unexpected DHCP messages, that is, there is no
	([clientState],[messageType]) case defined in the RFC 2131 FSM. - Added
	getAndCheckMessageTypeName(), it throws an exception when client receives
	unknown or invalid DHCP message type. - Removed some message types as
	they are not part of RFC 2131.

2013-12-05  Benmartin92

	DHCP: throw error when client is in unknown or invalid state, merge two
	ifs.

2013-12-05  Benmartin92

	DHCP: changed tests because of logging

2013-12-05  Benmartin92

	DHCP: added 2 tests, one renamed (dhcp_lifecycle_1->DHCP_lifecycle_1),
	logging.

2013-12-04  Benmartin92

	DHCP: chooseInterface(): throw new -> throw.

2013-12-02  Benmartin92

	DHCP: added startTime to the DHCPServer - startTime handling now works
	similarly as in UDP apps.

2013-12-02  Benmartin92

	DHCP: routing, logging. - delete last added route in unboundLease().

2013-12-02  Benmartin92

	DHCP: TODOs and comments. - added handleDHCPACK(DHCPMessage *) -
	handleTimer() throws exception when T2 expires and clientState !=
	RENEWING. - logging in handleDHCPMessage(). - extracted message type in
	processDHCPMessage().

	DHCP: Moved case into handleTimer, easier to see that all cases are
	covered.

2013-11-29  Andras Varga

	DHCP: docu, fixes

	- doc: remove text that generally explains DHCP and not this model
	- added auto interface selection (interface = default(""),
	chooseInterface())
	- manually firing NF_INTERFACE_IPv4CONFIG_CHANGED is unnecessary,
	 InterfaceTable already does that, and RoutingTable already fires
	 IPv4_ROUTE_ADDED
	- updateDisplayString(): display status over DHCP module, not the host

2013-11-29  Levente Mészáros

	DHCP: Removed obsolete check now that we support lifecycle interface.

2013-11-29  Levente Mészáros

	DHCP: DHCPMessage: 'flags' changed to 'broadcast', the only bit it
	contains

2013-11-27  Benmartin92

2013-11-20  Benmartin92

	DHCPClient: timer initializations moved to initialize().
	DHCPClient: serverId was removed from recordLease().
	DHCPClient: TODO ping. DHCPSever: // std::cout
	DHCPServer and Client: Major changes made both in client's and server's
	state machine. It is now extended with new states INIT-REBOOT and
	REBOOTING and with new message types DHCPNAK and DHCPDECLINE.

2013-09-20  Andras Varga

	App: Adapted DHCP to Lifecycle operations.

2013-04-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	App: DHCPServer: begin lifecycle - not completed

2013-11-18 Benjamin Seregi

	DHCPServer and Client: Major changes made both in client's and
	server's state machine. It is now extended with new states INIT-REBOOT
	and REBOOTING and with new message types DHCPNAK and DHCPDECLINE.

	With the new REBOOTING states scenarios with lifecycle events
	now work correctly.

	The server's performance modeling has been removed. The inner
	representation of the DHCP options are moved to a DHCPOptions
	INET message definition file.

	The client module currently does not support multiple DHCP servers
	and BOOTP relay agents.

	The whole implementation has been rewieved to bring it closer to
	the standards defined in RFC 2131 and 2132.
