	Ieee8021D* -> Ieee8021d* IEEE8021D* -> Ieee8021d* ieee8021D* ->
	ieee8021d*

	vlan: feature build test related changes

2013-12-04  Benmartin92

	IMACAddressTable: added class and moduleinterface for MAC tables.

2013-11-21  Zsolt Prontvai

	EtherSwitch: ned gui cosmetics

2013-11-18  Benmartin92

	Ieee8021D: minor changes, comments. Obsolete relay units were removed.

2013-11-13  Benmartin92

	EtherSwitch: L2NodeConfigurator is not needed in STP-unaware switch.

2013-11-07  Benmartin92

	EtherSwitch: spanningTreeProtocolVersion -> spanningTreeProtocol. - By
	default the switch is STP/RSTP unaware. - relayUnit implements
	IMACRelayUnit. - organized imports

2013-10-31  ProZsolt

	RSTP: deleted unnecessary files

2013-10-30  Benmartin92

	L2NetworkConfigurator, STP/RSTP: removed obsolete switches and examples.

2013-10-28  Benmartin92

	EtherSwitch, IEEE8021DRelay: changed to work with scenarios without STP.

2013-10-24  Benmartin92

	EtherSwitch: EtherSwitch now supports Spanning Tree algorithm.

	ISpanningTree: moduleinterface added to supports different versions of
	Spanning Tree protocols.

	SpanningTree: module renamed to "STP", this abbreviation refer to the
	protocol described in IEEE 802.1D-1998.

2013-10-17  Benmartin92

	STP: Spanning Tree Protocol added to INET.

2013-09-18  Benmartin92

	Switch:

	MACAddressTable:

	- MACAddressTable now has removeAgedEntriesIfNeeded() for efficient MAC
	 table purge.
	- Added clearTable() for lifecycle.

	MACRelayUnit: Added a simplified MACRelayUnit. It was necessary because
	MAC address table management has been separated from MACRelayUnitBase
	module.

	IMACRelayUnit: This moduleinterface changed to work with MACRelayUnit.
	There are no need for MAC address table configuration parameters anymore.

	EtherSwitch: Added MACAddressTable.

	Examples: ethernet/lans/largeNet example changed to work with the new
	RelayUnit.

	MACAddressTableAccess: MACAddressTable access name changed to macTable.

	InterfaceTable: find connected network layer (NL) by NL's gates that need
	to be called ifIn/ifOut

	The code committed in this patch was the solution before 2012-04-12, when
	it was changed to check upperLayerIn/upperLayerOut gates of the NIC
	module; however that's not so so good because we need to store the gate
	index of the gate of the *network layer*.

	This patch reverts to original behaviour; allows NICs not connected to a
	network layer; and provides better diagnistics.

	ASSUMPTIONS:
	1. The NIC module (ifmod) may or may not be connected to a network layer
	module (e.g. IPv4NetworkLayer or MPLS)
	2. If it *is* connected to a network layer (or a relay unit), the network
	layer module's gates must be called
	   ifIn[] and ifOut[], and NIC must be connected to identical gate
	indices in both vectors.
	3. If the NIC module is not connected to another modules ifIn[] and
	ifOut[] gates, we assume
	   that it is NOT connected to a network layer, and leave
	networkLayerGateIndex
	   in InterfaceEntry unfilled.
	4. The NIC may or may not connect to gates of the containing host
	compound module.

2013-06-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	switch/AP: made eth[] modules replaceable
	switch/AP: enabled external queue usage - fingerprints changed
	switch/AP: uses EthernetInterface, delete EthNic
	replaced EtherMAC modules to EthNic in the EtherSwitch and AccessPoint
	modules - fingerprints changed

	scalar outputs checked

2013-06-17  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherHost: changed submodule positions
	EtherSwitch: added lifecycle support
	EtherHost: added NodeStatus

2013-11-07  Benjamin Seregi

	EtherSwitch: added both STP and RSTP protocols. These protocols
	are optional features of an EtherSwitch. The spanningTreeProtocol
	parameter specifies which protocol will be used. The default value
	of spanningTreeProtocol is an empty string indicating that the
	switch is STP/RSTP unaware.

	IEEE8021DRelay: The default relayUnit was replaced with IEEE8021DRelay.
	It is intended for supporting STP/RSTP port roles and states. In STP/RSTP
	unaware cases, however, its behavior was not changed.

2013-08-22  ------ inet-2.2.0 released ------

2013-06-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherSwitch: made eth[] modules replaceable

2013-06-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherSwitch: replaced EtherMAC with EthernetInterface so that
	external queues can be used (useful for e.g. QoS)

2013-06-17  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherSwitch: added lifecycle support

2013-06-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherHost: added NodeStatus, required by lifecycle operations

	EtherSwitch: renamed mac[] submodule vector to eth[]

2013-03-21  Levente Meszaros

	EtherSwitch: added InterfaceTable unconditionally; also added
	NotificationBoard, required by InterfaceTable.

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

2012-04-26  Tamas Borbely

	EtherHost,EtherHost2: EtherQoSQueue used as external queue.
	EtherQosQueue contains two queues: one for PAUSE frames,
	and one for data frames. The 'queueType' parameter specifies
	the type of the latter.

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-01-14  Andras Varga

	Eth10M, Eth100M, Eth1G, Eth10G, Eth40G, Eth100G

2011-12-08  Andras Varga

	EtherHost: comment editing; reordering of submodules and connections
	for readability

2011-08-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherHost/EtherHost2 fix: display string contained "q=queue" instead of
	"q=txQueue" (EtherMAC internal queue object is called "txQueue")

2011-08-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherHost: use queueType="" instead of queueType="NoQueue" to select
	the internal queue of EtherMAC

2011-12-06  Andras Varga

	Added EtherHost2 that uses EtherEncap (EtherHost uses EtherLLC).

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-04-28  Rudolf Hornig

	EtherHost now defaults to internal queue implementation.

2011-04-27  Rudolf Hornig

	Ethernet refactoring. EtherHostQ removed. csmacdSupport parameter added
	to Switch, EtherHost and EthernetInterface.

2011-03-29  Zoltan Bojthe

	featuresupport: add ETHERNET feature

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Interfaces renamed to start with I.

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Module interface renaming.

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2010-06-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherMAC, EtherMacFullDuplex use IEtherMAC moduleinterface

2010-06-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	Rename modules

	EtherMAC2 to EtherMACFullDuplex, EtherHost2 to EtherHostFullDuplex

2010-06-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	Add EtherHostQ and EtherHost2Q NED files

2009-07-21  Andras Varga

	labels change: EtherFrame/PPPFrame labels on hosts/routers renamed to
	EtherFrame-conn/PPPFrame-conn, so that EtherMAC, PPPInterface etc are
	not offered by the palette when editing a network

2009-07-19  Andras Varga

	added further module @labels (ethernet-node, wireless-node, mpls-node);
	added default icons to several module types

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	more gate labels added; also, fixed case of TCPOut gates (i.e. they got
	renamed to tcpOut)

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	added @labels(node) to hosts/routers so that they appear at top of the
	palette when editing a network (in OMNeT++ 4.1+)

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2008-05-29  Andras Varga

	Moved Ethernet switch and host to nodes/ethernet:
	- EtherSwitch.ned was under networkinterfaces/etherswitch
	- EtherHost was under examples/ethernet/lans

	If you are interested in the early history of the code,
	change to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- NetworkInterfaces/EtherSwitch INET/src/networkinterfaces/etherswitch
