- Round Robin
-> make it a different on which moment the scheduling process is done. 
-> the TCPMultipathRoundRobinScheduler works like that
		- if data from application arrive, we enqueue to the available paths
		  Possible Alternatives:
		  		- Use a Pseudo Queue -> enqueue everything in a pseudo queue, if a connection is scheduled for sending, take as much data as the window allows
		  		- Use a Pseudo Queue -> enqueue everything in a pseudo queue, if a connection is scheduled for sending, take one packet and go to next
		  		- ...
Resume:
- Schedule all data over established paths
- Schedule all data over established path depending their CC window (Buffer Splitting/Buffer Blocking)

- Schedule established path with full window
- schedlue established path
